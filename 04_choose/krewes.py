"""
DISCO:
there is a random module in python, there are many functions/methods that come with
that library
dictionaries are iterable, but they are not sequences because you can't refer to the
keys as indeces, they are hashes
QCC:
How does random work? we think it refernces the time or mouse movement perhaps?
Do we have to change the devos into actual names later?
OPS SUMMARY:
Our code first picks a random key from a list of the available keys and then we pick a random person
from the list value associated with the key, then it returns that random person and the period
